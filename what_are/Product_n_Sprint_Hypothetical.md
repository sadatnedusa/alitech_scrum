### **Sample Sprint Backlog**
The **Sprint Backlog** is a subset of the Product Backlog that the team selects for completion during a specific sprint (e.g., 2-week sprint). It’s more actionable and detailed, including tasks and subtasks.

**Sprint Goal**: Implement core e-commerce functionalities: **User Login**, **Product Search**, and **Cart Functionality**.

### **Workflow**:
1. **Product Backlog**: This is the long-term list of all features, enhancements, fixes, and technical debt needed to achieve the product vision.
   - In our example, items like "User Login" and "Product Search" are key features.
   - The **Product Owner** continually refines and prioritizes this list based on user feedback, business value, and market conditions.

2. **Sprint Planning**: 
   - During **Sprint Planning**, the Scrum Team selects the highest-priority items from the **Product Backlog** for the upcoming sprint.
   - These items are broken down into smaller, actionable tasks in the **Sprint Backlog**.

3. **Sprint Backlog**:
   - The **Sprint Backlog** contains tasks that the development team will work on during the sprint.
   - Each task is small enough to be completed within the sprint (1-2 days), and each task is assigned to team members for accountability.
   - The team tracks progress during the sprint and ensures they are delivering on the Sprint Goal (e.g., implementing core e-commerce functionalities).

---

### **Sprint Execution**:
- **Daily Standups**: The team meets daily to discuss progress, potential blockers, and ensure the sprint stays on track.
- **Task Progression**: As tasks are completed, they move from "To Do" to "In Progress" and finally to "Done" on a board or task tracker.

---

### **Final Thoughts**:
- **Continuous Refinement**: Both the **Product Backlog** and **Sprint Backlog** should be continuously refined and updated. The Product Backlog should reflect changes in priorities or requirements, while the Sprint Backlog should be updated as tasks are completed or new tasks are identified during the sprint.
- **Communication**: Keeping both backlogs clear and prioritized ensures the team remains focused on the most important work and can adjust to changing needs.
